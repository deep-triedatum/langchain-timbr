"""Build columns/measures/relationships for SQL-gen consumption.

Anti-hallucination guarantee (constructor approach):
  The rebuilt relationships dict is constructed FROM SCRATCH by walking the
  validated paths and emitting, at each segment endpoint, only that concept's
  DIRECT properties + measures (sourced from ontology metadata). No graph
  traversal happens here — off-path relationships literally cannot appear in
  the output because we never enumerate them.

Anchor-rooted prefix invariant:
  Every emitted property prefix MUST start at the anchor concept. The Step 1
  LLM is allowed to return paths in either style:
    - Full-chain style: one multi-segment SelectedPath starting at the anchor.
    - Single-hop style: several 1-segment SelectedPaths chained end-to-start,
      where path P_k+1 begins where P_k ends.
  Both styles must produce identical output. We enforce this with a
  normalization pre-pass (``_normalize_paths_to_anchor``) that prepends the
  segments of an earlier path onto any path whose first segment doesn't start
  at the anchor. After normalization every path begins at the anchor and the
  walk emits anchor-rooted prefixes by construction.

The Step 1 LLM's selected_properties / selected_measures are advisory only —
they don't filter here. We always emit ALL direct properties + measures of
each path concept.
