"""Step 1 filter-and-path-inference prompt for the dynamic metadata pipeline.

Renders system + user messages as plain dicts so the LLM wrapper layer can
adapt them to whichever backend is in use (langchain ChatPromptTemplate works
on dicts via convert_to_messages, OpenAI raw, etc.).

Action grammar: the planner emits EXACTLY ONE action per response
(``build_path | expand_to | reanchor``). ``allowed_actions`` narrows the
prompt's documented action set when the orchestrator has exhausted a cap —
the LLM is shown only what it's still allowed to request, so capped actions
become un-emittable rather than being rejected after the fact.

``clarify`` is NOT supported by this pipeline — chat callers handle ambiguity
via re-ask, not in-band.

_PROMPT_INTRO = """You are filtering an ontology subgraph and selecting the traversal paths needed to answer a user's question via SQL.

You will receive:
- USER QUESTION: the natural-language question to answer.
- ANCHOR CONCEPT: the entity the SQL FROM clause will reference.
- ONTOLOGY SUBGRAPH: a Compact DDL listing of concepts, properties, measures, and relationships reachable from the anchor. The subgraph has TWO bands:
    * `## CONCEPTS` — concept blocks. Most are FULL-detail (description, props, measures, rels, incoming). Concepts promoted via a prior `expand_to` appear as MINIMAL blocks: heading + `description:` + a `rels:` block showing the concept's full outgoing relationships (including edges to `## REACHABLE` names). They omit `props:`, `measures:`, and `incoming:`. A MINIMAL block's rels are fully usable for `build_path` — an edge it shows to a `## REACHABLE` concept lets you END a path there with no further expand. **ANY concept with a `### <name>` heading in `## CONCEPTS` — FULL or MINIMAL, at any hop — is fully usable for `build_path` segments. Do NOT request expansion for these names.**
    * `## REACHABLE: name1, name2, ...` — names only. You can use one as the end of a path as soon as you see an edge pointing to it in a rendered `rels:` block — no expand needed to end there. Only `expand_to` a concept when you need to go THROUGH it to reach something further.

Edge direction in the subgraph (IMPORTANT — do NOT reverse):
- `rels:` lines under a concept are the ONLY traversable edges. Format `-[<rel>, <card>]-> <target>` means the edge goes FROM this concept TO <target>. Path segments MUST use this direction: {from: <this concept>, rel: <rel>, to: <target>}.
- `incoming:` lines (format `- <source>.<rel>`) are a REFERENCE LIST showing which other concepts in the subgraph point AT this concept. They are NOT traversable in this direction — the actual edge lives in `<source>`'s `rels:` block. If you need to use such an edge, write the segment in its native direction: {from: <source>, rel: <rel>, to: <this concept>}, not the reverse.
- Never invert a `rels:` edge. If the question implies a "reverse" traversal (e.g. starting from an `incoming:` source), START the path from that source concept; do not flip the from/to fields."""


_DECISION_PROCEDURE = """## DECISION PROCEDURE (follow in order, stop at first match)
1. Identify the TARGET: the deepest concept named or implied by the question.
2. Scan every visible `rels:` block for an edge pointing to TARGET.
3. If such an edge is visible → emit `build_path`. Do NOT expand.
4. Else if TARGET already has a `###` heading in `## CONCEPTS` → emit `build_path`. Do NOT expand.
5. Else if TARGET is in `## REACHABLE` → emit `expand_to: [TARGET]` (the destination itself, never an intermediate hop).
6. After any expansion, repeat from step 2.

**Generic guidance:**
- Always prefer `build_path` the moment any required edge becomes visible or the target is already in `## CONCEPTS`.
- Never expand a concept just because it is "on the way" — only expand the actual TARGET named/implied by the question.
- One `expand_to` on the destination reveals the full connecting chain (intermediates become usable without naming them yourself)."""


_ACTION_PREAMBLE = """Your task is to return a JSON object with EXACTLY ONE action per response. The shape of the object is one of the variants below — set the `action` field to indicate which variant you are emitting. Do NOT mix payloads from different actions in a single response."""


_BUILD_PATH_VARIANT = """### Action: `build_path`
Use this when you can construct the SQL traversal from concepts already in the `## CONCEPTS` (detail) band. This is the normal terminal action.

```json
{
  "action": "build_path",
  "selected_concepts": ["<concept>", ...],
  "selected_properties": ["<concept>.<property>", ...],
  "selected_measures": ["<concept>.<measure>", ...],
  "selected_paths": [
    {
      "path_id": "P1",
      "purpose": "<why this path is needed>",
      "segments": [
        { "from": "<concept>", "rel": "<rel_name>", "to": "<target>", "is_intermediate": false }
      ],
      "is_recursive": false
    }
  ],
  "transitivity_overrides": [
    { "rel": "<rel_name>", "target": "<target>", "level": 3 }
  ]
}
```

Field guidance for build_path:
- `selected_paths.segments[].is_intermediate` (default false): mark true ONLY when the segment's `to` concept exists solely to enable traversal to a deeper concept and the user would NOT expect that concept's data in the result. Anchor is never intermediate; terminal of any path is never intermediate.
- `selected_paths.is_recursive`: true only when the path includes a recursive relationship AND recursion is intended.
- `transitivity_overrides`: depth on a transitive/recursive relationship. One entry per (rel, target).

Path-construction rules:
- Each `path_id` is ONE linear chain: `to` of each segment is the `from` of the next. To reach two DIFFERENT targets from a shared concept (a FORK), emit SEPARATE `path_id`s — one linear chain each. NEVER put two branches inside one `path_id`.
- Each path's first segment must start from the anchor OR a concept reached by a prior path in this response.
- Prefer single-hop chaining, EXCEPT when a concept is only a routing waypoint to a deeper target you actually want: keep that waypoint as a NON-TERMINAL hop inside one longer chain and set `is_intermediate: true` on the segment ending at it. Splitting a path at a waypoint makes it a terminal, and terminals are always treated as result data.
- Use exact names from the subgraph. Prefer shorter paths when both reach the same target.

Example — a question that forks from anchor `a` to `b` AND to `d` (reached through waypoint `c`):
```json
{
  "action": "build_path",
  "selected_concepts": ["a", "b", "c", "d"],
  "selected_properties": ["b.b_name", "d.d_name"],
  "selected_measures": [],
  "selected_paths": [
    { "path_id": "P1", "purpose": "a's b data (one branch of the fork)",
      "segments": [ { "from": "a", "rel": "has_b", "to": "b", "is_intermediate": false } ],
      "is_recursive": false },
    { "path_id": "P2", "purpose": "d reached through waypoint c (other branch)",
      "segments": [ { "from": "a", "rel": "has_c", "to": "c", "is_intermediate": true },
                    { "from": "c", "rel": "has_d", "to": "d", "is_intermediate": false } ],
      "is_recursive": false }
  ],
  "transitivity_overrides": []
}
```
Why: the fork is emitted as TWO `path_id`s, not two branches in one. In P2, `c` is only a waypoint to `d`, so it stays a NON-TERMINAL hop with `is_intermediate: true` (it is NOT split into its own path_id, which would make it a terminal). Terminals `b` and `d` are never intermediate."""


_EXPAND_TO_VARIANT = """### Action: `expand_to`
Use ONLY after following the DECISION PROCEDURE. Expand the destination the question names, never a nearest hop.

```json
{
  "action": "expand_to",
  "expand_to": ["<menu_concept_name>"]
}
```

Field guidance for expand_to:
- Targets must come **exclusively** from `## REACHABLE`. Anything already in `## CONCEPTS` (FULL or MINIMAL) is invalid and will be rejected.
- Reveals the target's outgoing `rels:` plus any connecting intermediates from the current frontier in one step.
- If an edge to TARGET is already visible (per step 2 of the procedure) → do NOT expand; emit `build_path`.
- One expand reveals the full necessary chain — do not expand hop-by-hop.
- Consumes one round from the per-request expand budget."""


_REANCHOR_VARIANT = """### Action: `reanchor`
